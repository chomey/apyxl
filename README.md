# apyxl
apyxl is a command line tool that uses API defined by an Interface Definition Language (IDL), and generates corresponding API code in many output languages (or other such artifacts).

Example use cases for apyxl include:
- generating API bindings in multiple different language SDKs for the same target API
- generating cross-language interop code e.g. between a Rust library and a C#
- generating documentation for an API
- generating a visual representation of class dependencies
- converting from one IDL to another e.g. protobuf to flatbuffers
